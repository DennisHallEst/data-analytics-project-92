   - Sort order: by age category in natural order (16‚Äì25, 26‚Äì40, 40+)
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Explanation:
   - We use a CASE expression to classify each customer‚Äôs age.
   - Then group by that category and count how many customers belong to it.
   - ORDER BY uses CASE to maintain the desired category order.

   - Round down the total income to whole numbers.
